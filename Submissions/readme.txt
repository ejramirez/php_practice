This is a simple blog posting program for The City Press Calendar Websites.

There is a database that contains all the posts for different websites. Anyone can submit a post but it will not be displayed until after they have verified their post through their email.

Since this is technically finished and ready for use on websites I will call this Version 1.0, there will be updates to these scripts in the future.
